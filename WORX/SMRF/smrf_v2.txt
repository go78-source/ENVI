I think it depends on how PDAL is installed on your PC. On my main computer I (probably incorrectly) set conda / PDAL as path in environment. In this PC however conda is properly establishing a temp environment in powershell, thus requiring a new PDAL environment to be called upon each time a powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .ps1 job is started. 
This version has a variable defined for the system pdal path to be called in the in the startjob -> pipeline scriptblock.

the "v1" does not have pdal defined like at all. probably wont work on ur system. If it works itll work really really well so. idk. Ensure that ur in a good env. 
Probably call on powershell from inside anaconda instead of the other way around.

SMRF (Simple Morphological Filter) was used because USGS tiles contained mixed ground/non-ground classes and required reprocesing.
