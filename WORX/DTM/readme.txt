To be honest I was just tired and I wanted something to run before I went to bed. 
I was unable to achieve parallel processing for this, windows would not respect any type of "maxJobs" definition and Id end up getting 
insane cmd spam. All jobs would populate but PDAL wasnt actually touching them. I dont want to think about it.

Probably more PDAL path bs but it likely wouldnt be hard to just make a normal script that can parallel process

It should work without having to touch the .json as long as the variables stay defined in the batch file. just change ur input output path for YOUR wildcard

A 1-meter resolution is the USGS standard for terrain modeling and matches the point density of both the Camp Fire and Sierra Nevada datasets.
