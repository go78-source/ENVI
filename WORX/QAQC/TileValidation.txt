Get-ChildItem *.laz | ForEach-Object {

##this is kind of bad and slow but works in a pinch after you spend an entire day downloading .laz files only for 9/3000 of them to have unreadble headers.
##Just run in powershell pointed to whatever folder .laz is in. // attemps to read all headers, prints filename in red and moves on when it cant.
